INSERT INTO experimenteditor_spnpgnentry VALUES(1,0,695,'Engine Override Control Mode',2,'The override control mode defines which sort of command is used:



00 Override disabled - Disable any existing control commanded by the source of this command.

01 Speed control - Govern speed to the included “desired speed” value.

10 Torque control - Control torque to the included “desired torque” value.

11 Speed/torque limit control - Limit speed and/or torque based on the included limit values.  The speed limit governor is a droop governor where the speed limit value defines the speed at the maximum torque available during this operation.



If a device wants to know whether it has access to the engine, there are several possibilities:



a. Comparing its command with the actual engine broadcasts.

b. Looking at command modes from other devices.

c. Looking to the engine and retarder torque mode.



Remarks:



a. The realization of a torque limit (minimum selection) is possible by setting the speed limit to a high value (0xFAFF).

b. The realization of a speed limit (minimum selection) is possible by setting the torque limit to a high value (0xFA).

c. Limiting the retarder torque means to limit the magnitude of the torque request.  As the brake torque is represented by negative torque values, the limitation must be done by a maximum selection of the requested torque and the retarder internal torque signals.

d. For torque increasing functions, time limits for the torque or speed value (command) and the direct modes are desirable.



e. The selection of which device has control of the engine\'s speed or torque depends on the override mode priority (see SPN 897) with the highest priority device gaining control.  In the case of two devices with identical priority, the engine responds to speed/torque control commands over speed/torque limit commands and will act on the speed or torque commands on a first come, first served basis.  The torque limit will be a “lowest wins” selection (e.g., if one device commands 60% limit and another 80% limit, then the engine will limit torque to 60%).

These transmission responses occur regardless of shift selector (Forward, Neutral or Reverse) position at the time the request is received.



This request would typically come from a component wishing to override the vehicle operator’s ability to shift or keep the transmission in Reverse.  For example, the control system of a rear-loading refuse packer may wish to prevent shifts to reverse when it detects the presence of someone behind the vehicle.

Forward selector position from drive (0xF5 to 0xEF) – Indicates shift selector position in reference to the ‘Drive’ position on the selector.  It is possible that the shift selector software may not know the number of forward ranges.  The shift selector may identify the position selected by the operator while the transmission ECU determines what range or gear that represents.  If there is a digital display, the transmission ECU would communicate what is to be displayed via another message such as ETC#2 or ETC#7.



For example:  Consider a vehicle with a 5-speed automatic transmission with the shift lever on the column. Suppose that shift selector has a limited number of positions, such that having positions for D-4-3-2-1 is not an option. For this example, assume there are only have enough lever positions for D-3-2-1. Pulling the lever into "D" will put the transmission in 5th (highest gear).  It is desired that pulling the lever to the physical “3” position will limit the transmission to a maximum range of 3rd gear.



When the selector is pulled down into "3", the shifter selector itself has no way of correlating this physical lever position to the desired gear; it would have to be calibrated with software to tell it this information. If not calibrated, the shift selector cannot directly command the transmission to go to 3rd gear; it only knows it\'s one notch below drive.



However, if "D-1" (lever position, as opposed to desired gear) is broadcast by the selector, the transmission ECU can receive this and then make the determination of what range is desired. The benefit is that no specific calibration of the shift selector is required. 



Between selector positions (0xEE to 0xE2) – Indicates the shift selector is not in an appropriate position.  If a lever-type shift selector with a mechanical display is stuck between detents, it may appear to the operator that it is in the desired position when in fact it is not. The shift selector may be capable of reporting only that it is between positions or that it is between forward or reverse positions. If known, the transmission ECU may respond differently depending on which positions are involved.



Reselect current position (0xE1) - If the TC1 message continues to send the position last selected, then a capability to reselect the same position is required.  For example:  If a ‘Neutral to Drive’ shift is selected and that shift is inhibited (say for high engine speed), it may be necessary for the operator to reselect ‘Drive’ after the inhibit conditions pass in order for the transmission ECU to honor the request.



Position unknown and/or no buttons pressed (0xE0) - A push-button style shift selector with momentary contact buttons may send this indicator after initialization before any buttons are pressed, or before the transmission ECU determines and communicates the initial selection.  This indicator could also be sent between button presses as an alternative to sending the last button press.','Transmission Control 1','3','When active; 50 ms to transmission and axles','gear value','-125','8');

INSERT INTO experimenteditor_spnpgnentry VALUES(40,1024,4099,'XBR urgency',8,'The idea of the urgency value is to adjust the endurance brake integration behavior in the EBS system according to the traffic situation.



On low urgency values (0%, e.g. downhill cruise control or preceding vehicle far ahead) the brake system shall primarily use endurance brakes to reduce lining wear.



On high urgency values (100%, e.g. vehicle close up or a vehicle cuts into the traffic line just before host vehicle) the brake system is expected to gain the demanded deceleration (acceleration) as fast as possible.



Values:

0% - Situation not critical; low retarder dynamics are tolerated. Activation of the foundation brakes after a time if retarder performance is insufficient

y % - Faster activation of foundation brakes to compensate retarder performance, linear interpolation between 0 and  100%

100% - Low retarder dynamics shall be fully compensated by the foundation brakes



Notes:

- This parameter has only an effect if XBR EBI switch is set to "10: endurance brake integration allowed"

- XBR urgency makes sense only if the XBR request(s) is (are) processed in one device like the EBS controller which also sends TSC1 to the retarder(s). Such a data flow diagram is shown in figure PGN1024_A. When the Retarder is controlled directly by the XBR transmitter XBR urgency should be set to not available.



In adaptive cruise control (ACC) operation there are situations where it is useful to have as less lining wear as possible like keeping the set speed on going downhill. It would not be useful to activate foundation brakes in such a situation except when the capabilities of the endurance brakes are not sufficient.

 

In other situations like emergency braking or fast reaction on a car that cut in at a short distance in front of the own vehicle a reaction as fast as possible is needed. In such cases low retarder dynamics must be compensated by the foundation brakes.



There are two different ways to integrate the endurance brakes into the adaptive cruise control.

a) the request for deceleration could be processed by the EBS system completely. This means that the EBS receives the deceleration demand and activates the friction and/or the endurance brakes accordingly. EBS is sending the TSC1 to the retarder. (see figure PGN1024_A dataflow diagram for external brake request)

b) the ACC sends XBR to the brake controller and TSC1 to the endurance brakes.



In case "a)" the ACC system does not have direct control of the endurance brakes. To adjust the endurance brakes according to the traffic situation (high or low urgency values see above) this new SPN is needed.



If the retarder performance is not sufficient (e.g. because of high retarder temperature) the foundation brakes will be added automatically. This case of not sufficient retarder performance cannot be covered by switching EBI mode from 01 (endurance brakes only) to EBI mode 10 (endurance brake integration allowed) because the actual deceleration caused by the retarder is less than the requested decelleration. A simple switching (01 to 10) would cause an uncomfortable jerk.

INSERT INTO experimenteditor_spnpgnentry VALUES(97,37632,5666,'NM Control Mode Indicator',4,'This four bit parameter is used to define the purpose of the NM message as follows:



Mode 0 – Set Pending NAME



This form of the message is the command to the target CA at the destination address in the CAN Identifier to change its pending NAME to the one contained in the message. All data fields of the message are required.



The “Commanded” parameter fields are the new (i.e. commanded) NAME field values. These shall be qualified with the qualifier flags.  A value of “0” in the qualifier flags indicates that the associated field should be changed to the value in the corresponding parameter field in the message.  A value of “1” indicates that the associated field should remain unchanged.



The NAME checksum byte contains the arithmetic sum of the 8 bytes of the target CAs original NAME truncated to 8 least significant bits. This is used as a security check to make sure the command message has been received by the correct CA. This check guards against the possibility of the SA having changed through the address arbitration process.



Mode 1 – Pending NAME



This form of the message is sent by the target CA and is a response to a request for “pending” NAME. The CA’s pending NAME is contained in the “Commanded” parameter fields.  All “Commanded” parameter fields of the NAME are required. The qualifier flags and NAME checksum are not used and shall be set to all 1s.  If the Pending NAME has not been set or is not valid, this form of the message shall not be sent.  Rather, the NACK (mode 4) shall be sent.



Mode 2 – Current NAME



This form of the message is sent by the target CA and is a response to a request for “current” NAME. The CA’s current NAME is contained in the “Commanded” parameter fields.  All fields of the NAME are required. The qualifier flags and NAME checksum are not used and shall be set to all 1s.



Mode 3 – NAME ACK



This form of the message is sent by the target CA indicating the most recently received “Set Pending NAME” command has been successfully fulfilled.  The CA’s pending NAME is contained in the “Commanded” parameter fields.  All “Commanded” parameter fields of the NAME are required.  The qualifier flags and the NAME checksum are not used and shall be set to all 1s.



Mode 4 – NAME NACK



This form of the message is sent by the target CA indicating the most recently received “Set Pending NAME” command or “Request Pending NAME” command was not successful.  The control mode parameter and the Error Code parameter are the only valid fields in this form of the message. All other fields shall be set to all 1s.



Mode 5 – Request Pending NAME

 

This form of the message is sent by the commanding CA and is a request for the target CA to respond with its “pending” NAME.  The control mode parameter is the only valid field in this form of the message. All other fields shall be set to all 1s.



Mode 6 – Request Current NAME 



This form of the message is sent by the commanding CA and is a request for the target CA to respond with its “current” NAME.  The control mode parameter is the only valid field in this form of the message. All other fields shall be set to all 1s.



Mode 7 – Adopt Pending NAME



This form of the message is sent by the commanding CA and is a “trigger” command to the targeted CA, (or all CAs with pending NAMEs if sent to the global address) to adopt their pending NAME as its current NAME and to initiate the Address Claim procedure with this new NAME. The control mode parameter is the only valid field in this form of the message. All other fields are set to all 1s. This form of the message may be sent to a specific SA or to the global address.



Mode 8 – Request NAME Address Claim



This form of the message is used to request that a CA whose SA is unknown to the requester send the address claim message, thus allowing the requester to determine the CA’s SA.  All or portions of the NAME may be specified in the request using the qualifier flags. This form of the message shall be sent to the global address.



If a CA receives this request and the indicated qualifier fields match the current NAME, it shall send its address claim using its current NAME.  If a CA receives this request but it doesn’t match the indicated fields of the current NAME, it shall not send an address claim and shall not send the NAME NACK form of the NM message.

Products implementing to February 1996 version of the document will always have this bit set to a one. When this is the case, the SPN is in either Version 1, 2 or 3 format. The original publication of this recommended practice defined that this bit be set to one. This particular implementation is no longer permitted. It provides context for some implementations prior to the adoption of the recommended setting as zero (version 4 definition).



To clarify the ordering of bits and bytes within the SPN parameter (which is 19 bits long) and to keep that ordering consistent with other parameters in J1939-71 and J1939-73, the bit order has been respecified. See Version 4 below for the recommended formatting.  Version 4 is required for any device complying with emissions related components.



To reduce problems in interpretation of the SPNs the bit between the FMI field and the Occurrence Count field, previously reserved, will be cleared to zero to identify use of the currently specified SPN bit pattern. This bit now comprises an SPN Conversion Method for the purpose of maintaining usability of those implementations that are already in use.

The purpose of the following switch information is to define what data should be reported based on what type of switch is used.



1.  A toggle button with two states can be used, in which the button is either in the manual or the auto position at all times.  Toggle button usage is as follows:

        Manual Position  = 0010 Manual button pressed

        Auto Position       = 0011 Automatic button pressed



2.   The momentary rocker switch may be used, where the default is the no button pressed position.  The user can press the rocker into the manual position, and when pressure is released, it will return to the no button pressed position.  The user may also press the rocker into the auto position, and when pressure is released, it will return to the no button pressed position.  Momentary rocker button usage is as follows:

        Auto Button Pressed  = 0011 Automatic button pressed



3.    The momentary contact button pair may be used, where the default is no buttons being pressed.  The user can press the manual button, and when pressure is released, it will return to the no button pressed position.  The user may press the auto button, and when pressure is released, it will return to the no button pressed position.  Momentary contact buttons (button pair) usage is as follows:

Only one of the following states will be active at a time.   Below are the data values defined for each switch type that may be used in this application.  The purpose of the following switch information is to define what data should be reported based on what type of switch is used.



1.  The momentary rocker switch may be used, where the default is the no button pressed position.  The user can press the rocker into the increment button pressed position, and when pressure is released, it will return to the no button pressed position.  The user may also press the rocker into the decrement button pressed position, and when pressure is released, it will return to the no button pressed position.  Momentary rocker button usage is as follows:



     No Button Pressed = 0000 No button pressed

     Increment Button Pressed  = 0001 Increment button pressed

     Decrement Button Pressed  = 0010 Decrement button pressed



2.  The momentary contact button pair may be used, where the default is the no buttons pressed position.  The user can press the increment button, and when pressure is released, it will return to the no buttons pressed position.  The user may press the decrement button, and when pressure is released, it will return to the no buttons pressed position.  Momentary contact button (button pair) usage is as follows:



     No Button Pressed = 0000 No button pressed

1.   The switch state can be read in two ways.  One method uses the direct analog switch input to determine the switch state, while the second method relies on a secondary control to read the analog input, then relay the information on the data link.  The parameter is designed to provide the actual switch state to other controls that need the information.

When in automatic mode, the blade automatically adjusts its position to the center of the blade to maintain a desired grade offset.  Only one of the following states will be active at a time.  Below is extended information describing each command.  The purpose of this information is to define what command state should be reported based on what auto control mode command is deemed appropriate by the operational specifications of the system.



   0000 Auto Allowed - Auto mode permitted as appropriate (auto button was pushed or directly returned from Suspend Auto condition)

   0001 Activity Allows Auto - Auto mode permitted only if the primary control system detects operator activity.  The control issuing this command does not have sufficient information/reason to absolutely allow Auto mode (state 0000) or not allow Auto mode (state 0100).  The control issuing this command is permitting the primary control system to operate in auto mode only if the primary control system detects operator activity, such as direct input to the primary control system.  If the primary control system does not detect operator activity, then the control issuing this command is not allowing auto mode. For example, the control issuing this command has detected no operator activity yet it acknowledges that there may be other sources of operator activity that might make auto mode permissible.

   0010 Suspend Auto - Auto mode is temporarily not allowed and the control issuing this command wants the primary control system to automatically return to the previous state (Auto or Manual) when the suspend auto condition is removed.

   0011 Service Mode - Auto mode is permitted only for special services such as calibrations.

   0100 Auto Not Allowed - Auto mode is not allowed under any condition

Note:  

The control issuing this command is aware that it does not have access to all information that the primary controller of the Land Leveling System attachment has access to.  Therefore, it commands the Land Leveling system to activate a auto blade mode based on the input it has access to.  In some cases, like in the "Activity Allows Auto" situation, the control knows the Land Leveling system has access to an additional display (which has switches and several buttons) which may help determine if an operator is present.

To prevent unwanted grease lubrication, a timing cycle clock is used. This clock only ticks for the time the vehicle or machine is in that defined state. Starting or stopping of the clock is controlled using an external input. The status of this timing cycle clock shall be reported to the operator by using the proposed SPN.','Vehicle/Chassis Lubrication System 2','2.5','500 ms','bit','0','8');

The original publication of this recommended practice defined that this bit be set to one. This particular implementation is no longer permitted. It provides context for some implementations prior to the adoption of the recommended setting as zero (version 4 definition).



To clarify the ordering of bits and bytes within the SPN parameter (which is 19 bits long) and to keep that ordering consistent with other parameters in J1939-71 and J1939-73, the bit order has been respecified. See Version 4 below for the recommended formatting.  Version 4 is required for any device complying with emissions related components.



To reduce problems in interpretation of the SPNs the bit between the FMI field and the Occurrence Count field, previously reserved, will be cleared to zero to identify use of the currently specified SPN bit pattern.

These heights are discrete levels.  They are the upper level, lower level, normal level 1, normal level 2, normal level 3, customer level, and preset level.  Refer to Figure SPN1734_A.



· Upper Level is the highest mechanically available height of the vehicle.  

· Lower Level is the lowest mechanically available height of the vehicle.  



Normal Levels 1, 2 and 3 are heights normally used during driving.

· Normal Level 1 is most often used and is given by design.  

· Normal Level 2 may be chosen, for example, to be lower than Normal Level 1 for the purpose of reducing fuel consumption while driving on highways.  

· Normal Level 3 may be chosen above Normal Level 1 for driving off road.



The preset level has to be set by means of ASC 6 (PGN: 53504).



States \'Rasing\' and \'Lowering\' are only active when corresponding states are requested in SPN 1751.  This provides the possibility to adjust vehicle to a level other than the predefined levels.

100b - Hold Mode—Used to indicate that the ACC has lost the previous target vehicle and is in HOLD mode. In this mode, the ACC shall limit the speed to the speed held when the target was lost. For example,  if the driver activates the typical cruise buttons (Resume/Inc/Dec) the HOLD mode shall be exited and normal cruise functionality resumed. If a new target is detected, the Distance Control Active mode (010b) is again entered, unless existing conditions prohibit this.

101b - Finish Mode—Used to indicate that ACC is on with no target ahead, and ACC is currently sending control messages to return to the driver’s set speed. This occurs when the target the ACC system was tracking moves out of the way so ACC returns the vehicle to the driver’s set speed.
